We will continue to use the mortality dataset from the GLM class for questions # 1 - 5: 

"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh-jackson/bayes/master/static/Lectures/mortality.csv"

For questions # 6 - 8 please use the KN dataset: 
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh-jackson/bayes25/refs/heads/main/KN.csv"


1.  Run a logistic regression where premature mortality is predicted by risky behavior. Interpret the coefficients in terms of:

a.  Logits
b.  Logits converted to odds
c.  Logits converted to probability
d.  NHST test using a confidence interval of your choosing
e.  NHST test using Probability of Direction
f.  NHST test using ROPE
g.  NHST test using Bayes Factor

2.  Create predicted values for different levels of risky behavior. What is my probability of premature mortality if I was 1 sd deviation below the mean of risky behavior? 2 SDs above? Make sure to include CIs around these estimates.

3.  Graph the predicted relationship between risky behavior and premature mortality with probability as the Y axis.

4.  Run two new models with risky behavior AND IQ as predictors of premature mortality -- one where they are main effects and another where they interact. Calculate psis-loo and waic for these two models and use them to compare with the previous model from #1. Which model is a better model?

5.  Create your own version of pp_check on the model in #4 to examine the posterior predictive distribution. Interpret.

6. With the KN dataset, run 4 different models (poisson, negative binomial, and one zero inflated and one hurdle model (ZIP or ZINB and HP or HNB) predicting count of number of jobs one has had, accounting for number of years work by the personality trait of achievement (mpqachievement). If this was your data what model would you choose, and why?
